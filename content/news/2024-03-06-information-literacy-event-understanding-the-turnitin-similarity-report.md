The Adam Kurniawan Library hosted an online event titled “Understanding the Turnitin Similarity Report.” This event was conducted on Google Meet. The purpose of this event is to sensitize students about using Turnitin as a plagiarism checker for their writings. Usually, the university has set a certain standard for the Turnitin exam because students cannot plagiarize other academic papers and include them in their writing. This is why the information about Turnitin is important for students.

As we know, Turnitin is a software for students to check similarities with other academic sources. Many students are still unaware of what the university has to offer them. There is special Turnitin access for a thesis that is only accessible to students. All they have to do is create their account and enter the class ID with the corresponding password. Once they have their account, they can immediately use it to check the similarity of their thesis. (Marco/Editor)
