Adam Kurniawan Library hosted an online event titled “Library Rules and Regulations.” The focus of this event was on the library rules and regulations that students must follow. Many students still do not know the rules and regulations of the library. For example, they come to the library wearing shorts. Some students get their food and drinks in the library. This behavior led us librarians to make it clear to students that they must follow the rules.

Another topic discussed at this event was the OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog) of the Adam Kurniawan Library. It is an important library tool that students should know, how to make it easier to get books on the shelves. Since many of the students did not yet know how to use OPAC, it became necessary to inform students about how they can use OPAC. We hope more students will have a clearer understanding of how to use OPAC. (Marco/Editor)
