On Thursday, 10 August 2023, Adam Kurniawan Library (AKL) held a webinar with the topic “The Strategy for Submitting Your Article to an International Journal”. This event was a collaboration between President University and Emerald Publishing. The purpose of this webinar was to give participants the strategies for submitting articles to international journals since publishing articles is one of the lecturer’s roles as an academician.

The presenters of this webinar were Mr. William Loh from Emerald Publishing Malaysia and Dr.Adhi Setyo Santoso a lecturer from Master of Technology Management President University. Mr. William Loh presented the strategies for submitting articles from the point of view of the publisher, while Dr. Adhi Setyo Santoso shared his experiences as a lecturer who has published several articles in international journals. Some key points in publishing an international standard work are preparing the manuscript, structuring the paper, paying attention to copyright and plagiarism and peer review. We hope this webinar could give useful insights for the lecturers of President University in publishing more articles to international standard journals. (Chrisanny, Photo: Chrisanny)
