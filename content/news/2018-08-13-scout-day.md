**Adam Kurniawan Library, President University –** Why is the scout day commemorated every August 14th?

The long journey of guiding movements brought by the Dutch since the colonial era, before Indonesian independence was swayed, but after the independence of the guiding movement or later known as scouts always got their own appreciation room every year, exactly two days before the seventeen uforia in Indonesia, scout day falls on August 14th. Usually, scout celebrations are always accompanied by camping, and also apples, from elementary, middle, highschool, to even students.

In September 1945 a number of figures from the Indonesian scouting movement gathered to hold a meeting in Yogyakarta. From the results of the Congress on 27-29 September 1945, the Indonesian People’s Guide was formed.

After the twists and turns of the travels of the organizations that had split, finally in 1961 produced a Presidential Decree No. 238 of 1961 concerning the Scout Movement, on May 20, 1961, signed by Ir. Djuanda as Acting President of the Republic of Indonesia, because President Sukarno was visiting Japan.

In 1961-1999 with Presidential Decree No. 238 In 1961, the Indonesian Scout Movement began with a new situation called the Young Karana Movement or Scout Movement. Scout symbol in the form of Tunas, then on August 14, 1961, officially the Scout Movement was introduced to the public after President Sukarno conferred the banner of the Scout Movement with Presidential Decree No. 448 of 1961.
