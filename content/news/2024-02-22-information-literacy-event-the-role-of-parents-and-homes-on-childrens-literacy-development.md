On Tuesday (20/02) The Adam Kurniawan Library hosted a program titled “The Role of Parents and Homes on Children’s Literacy Development”. Mrs. Grace Amialia Anfentonanda, S.Pd., Gr., M.Pd., a lecturer at President University with a focus on teacher education and child development, be the keynote speaker.

This information literacy event also clarifies that the family, which is the smallest social unit, is where children’s reading development begins. In order to foster a literacy culture inside the home, moms and fathers play a crucial role. Practicing active listening and serving as a discussion partner for kids is an attempt to extend kids’ literacy abilities beyond book reading. It is intended that by taking part in this event, attendees will be able to instill a culture of information literacy and help kids become self-sufficient adults.
