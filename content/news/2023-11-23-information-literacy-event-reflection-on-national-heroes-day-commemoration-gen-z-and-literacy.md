On Tuesday (07/11), Adam Kurniawan Library held an event in collaboration with Dinas Perpustakaan dan Kearsipan Pemerintah Daerah Kabupaten Bekasi, West Java, titled “Reflection on National Heroes Day Commemoration, Gen Z and Literacy”. The keynote speaker is Mr. Dr. Ir. Robert Pangihutan Radjagoekgoek, S.Sos., S.H., M.H., CLL., CLA., a Lecturer at President University and an expert in General Law subjects. These characteristics, which Mr. Robert shares with the Z generation social movements, are the unprecedented use of social media, the combined effects of extensive postsecondary education and employment precarity, and the discourse of intersectionality. These dimensions are cross-cutting and relate to the social characteristics of their leaders and activists and their dominant modes of organization and strategy.

To prepare for the Golden Generation of 2045, Generation Z should adopt warrior ideals now through various programs and activities, education being among them. education preparation, including the state of the curriculum, the teaching personnel, the infrastructure, funding employment programs, and supporting the legal pitfalls. A younger generation that is able, capable, and skilled to compete with other nations will be produced by the seriousness with which the world of education is building up today. (Anindya/Librarian).
