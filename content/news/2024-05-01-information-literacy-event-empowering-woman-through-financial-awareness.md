The Adam Kurniawan Library held an event titled “Empowering woman through Financial Awareness” on Thursday, April 25. The keynote speaker at President University are Dr. Supeni A. Mapuasari, SE, MSc.; Mrs. Vita Elisa Fitriana, SE, MSc.; and Mrs. Chita Oktapriana S.Akun, M.Ak, CSRS, CMA, whose lectures on banking and accounting.

This information literacy event also makes it clear that, depending on how and where it is delivered, financial education can be a worthy goal. Financial education has been carefully investigated by behavioral finance to show its strengths and weaknesses. Financial literacy encompasses both knowledge and abilities, including the ability to analyze loan offers, create budgets, and comprehend interest rates. (Anindya/Librarian)
