**Adam Kurniawan Library, President University –** International Day of Justice is an international day celebrated worldwide on July 17 of each year as part of efforts to recognize the emerging international criminal justice system. July 17 was chosen because it was the anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute in July 1998.

The Rome Statute is the result of a Diplomatic Conference in Rome that agrees to establish a permanent mechanism of the International Criminal Court through the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute the most serious crimes perpetrators of war crimes, genocide, crimes of aggression and crimes against humanity .

World International Day of Judicial Convention was adopted on 1 June 2010 at the Rome Statutes Review Conference held in Kampala (Uganda), where the State Assembly decided to celebrate July 17 as International Criminal Justice Day. Every year, the world community that upholds the respect and protection of human rights with all citizens worldwide uses today to host events to promote international criminal justice, especially as a form of support for the International Criminal Court. Today has been successful enough to attract the attention of International news, and for the group to use the day to focus on certain issues such as genocide in Darfur, Falun Dafa, and serious crimes against women.

The commemoration of the International Day of Justice National in Indonesia is generally conducted every year to encourage the Indonesian government to ratify the Rome statutes that have not yet been done.
