On Wednesday (26/10), Adam Kurniawan Library held an Information Literacy Event “See The World with IISMA Scholarship” with Ahda Ayudia Hairisa as the IISMA Awardee to the University of Limerick Ireland 2021, and Kadek Astri Dwijayanti as the IISMA Awardee to the University of Warsaw Poland 2021 came as the speakers. They shared their experience being students abroad, how to build personal branding, and also to know more about passion and confidence.

This event has provided a lot of strategies, tips, and tricks that students can implement and prepare for IISMA requirements. The event ran effectively and was expected to be helpful for the students, especially for Students.

Note: For more information regarding IISMA, students can come to International Office (Building A Room 320).
