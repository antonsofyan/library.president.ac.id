Mrs. Wiwin presented material on the role of narcotics and dangerous drugs in international diplomacy. Drugs are a transnational crime requiring attention, prevention, and countermeasures from countries worldwide. The spread and use of drugs must also be addressed through international conventions and legislation. As citizens of the world, we must remain aware of the spread and abuse of drugs.

Dr. Grace discussed drugs from a legal sociology perspective. She discussed the role of the family in the fight against drugs at various levels, from prevention, where the family is the first and main community for every human being, to rehabilitation, where the family plays a crucial role in helping drug users recover. This interesting topic is also integrated with the world’s advanced technological conditions.

Ms. Louisa emphasized the dangers of drugs to children. She defined drugs and classified them from legal and medical perspectives. She also explained how the effects of dangerous drugs can affect people of all ages, starting with children. Once again, the family as the frontline and the law as a monitoring tool are important for preventing drug abuse.

Through this event, the Adam Kurniawan Library hopes to encourage our youth to prevent drug usage within their families and communities.
