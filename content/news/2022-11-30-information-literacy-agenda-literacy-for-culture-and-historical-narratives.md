Ms. Mabel Tang from Springer Nature came as an expert in the event giving training to the participants on how to use Springer. She also taught the participants how to start writing papers, choose a research topic, and how to submit a paper to a Springer Nature publisher.

After attending the event, the students are expected to get information about various subjects in the e-journals collection and how to search for them on the platform. (Anindya/Librarian)
