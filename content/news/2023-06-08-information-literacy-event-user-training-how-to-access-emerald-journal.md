On Wednesday (24/05), Adam Kurniawan Library held an event in association with Emerald Publishing titled “User Training How to Access Emerald Journal”. The speaker is Mr. Irwan Sukardi as Business Manager, Emerald Publishing.

Adam Kurniawan Library organizes a Webinar for all students, lecturers, and also staff members. The purpose of this webinar was to give attendees an introduction to the many types of journals, tips for downloading articles, and information on literature reviews. Additionally, this information literacy event offers an exchange of knowledge on publication advice, how to navigate the peer-review process, special issues, high-quality research, and how to find categorized articles in JCR and Scopus.

We hope this webinar could benefit the civitas academic of the President University in particular especially those who utilize journal articles as research reference sources, (Anindya/Librarian).
