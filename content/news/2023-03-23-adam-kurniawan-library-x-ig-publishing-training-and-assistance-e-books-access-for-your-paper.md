Mr. Deden Ramdhani from iGroup came to the event as an expert to train the students on how to use IG Library. The event was divided into three sessions. The first session was from 09.00 am to 10.00 am, the second session was from 11.00 am to 12.00 am and the third session was from 01.00 pm to 02.00 pm.

The session was designed for the students to practice and gain experience in searching for information on the IG Library platform.

After attending the session, the students are expected to get information about various subjects in the e-book collection and how to search for them on the platform. (Anindya/Librarian).
