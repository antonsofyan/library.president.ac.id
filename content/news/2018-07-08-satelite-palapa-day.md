**Adam Kurniawan Library, President University –** On July 9, Indonesia will commemorate Palapa Satellite Day. The satellite, taken from the name of the vow spoken by Majapahit’s patron, Gajah Mada, was launched in 1976 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA.

When launched, the first Palapa satellite orbiting the Earth is a generation A1. Except for the parabolic reflectors, the Palapa is identical to the Canadian Anik satellite and the Westars have Western Union.

Palapa A1 brings pride to the people of the archipelago, because this technology makes Indonesia in the third position after the US and Canada in the technology bersatelitan. Communications satellites placed at an altitude of 36,000 kilometers above Earth and controlled by the Main Control Station (SPU) in Cibinong, West Java, connect the archipelago.

Generation A1, which continued A2, lasted only for several years. A1 expired in June 1985, while A2 in January 1988. The two satellite efforts continued with the next generation, Palapa Seri B.

Generation B is four times stronger and twice as big as the previous generation. Even within reach, Palapa B is wider. If Palapa A is only designed for domestic / regional communications, Palapa B can reach the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore.

Unfortunately, Palapa B2 was placed in an “exhaust” orbit due to technical malfunction. The Indonesian government had claimed insurance of US $ 75 million for the damage and requested successor successors orbiting three years later.

The generation of Palapa B is continued up to B2, B2P, B2R, and B4. Before finally replaced by generation C. However, the early two generations A and B became the main pioneer of Nusantara communication. Without both, the community is not connected, inter-island communication will be difficult, and eventually extends to all the joints of life.
