It featured a thorough introduction to the university’s digital academic tools, followed by a hands-on practice session in which students explored the platforms on their own devices.

The event went smoothly, with active student participation throughout. Many students participated enthusiastically in the practice session and asked insightful questions, demonstrating their interest in mastering the digital tools necessary for academic success.
