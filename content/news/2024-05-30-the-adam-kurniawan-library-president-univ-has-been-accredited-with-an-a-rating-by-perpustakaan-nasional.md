The Adam Kurniawan Library at President University (Presuniv) has finally been officially accredited with an A rating by the National Library of the Republic of Indonesia (Perpustakaan Nasional, Republik Indonesia) after a lengthy process. certificate receipt of the accreditation certificate marked this achievement in March 2024. Neilany Edwina, the Head of the Adam Kurniawan Library, stated, “Being accredited with an A rating means that our performance is in line with the standards set by the National Library.” Neilany explained that while the accreditation process previously only encompassed six components, it has now expanded to nine. “These components include services, cooperation, collections, library material organization, human resources, facilities/buildings, budget, library management, and collection maintenance, each with several sub-criteria,” she said.

The accreditation process began with the submission of documents to the SiPAPI (Sistem Penilaian Akreditasi Perpustakaan Indonesia or Indonesian Library Accreditation Assessment System) application, followed by verification, and culminated with assessors visiting the Adam Kurniawan Library. Neilany disclosed, “The assessors were from the National Library as well as from the Regional Library and Archives Agency of West Java Province, along with their team members. They directly assessed our performance according to the nine criteria.” As a result, the Adam Kurniawan Library was accredited with an A rating, signifying excellence, which is the highest rank. “We hope this accreditation will also benefit the other study programs currently undergoing the accreditation process,” she added.
