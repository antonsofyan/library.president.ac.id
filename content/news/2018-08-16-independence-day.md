**Adam Kurniawan Library, President University –** Indonesia’s Independence Day is a day that marks Indonesia as being declared independent from the Netherlands. Today is filled with celebrations and celebrations. Despite the fact that Indonesia declared its independence from the Dutch Government on August 17, 1945, it was not until 2005 that the Netherlands accepted this date as the official date for Indonesia’s independence.

Organize groups of people for community service activities where the settlement area is cleaned. Environmental associations coordinate special activities for children and even ask for sponsors for gifts for children. People are asked to fly the flag at their place of residence for a certain period of time. President and address of the nation on the eve of Independence Day. There are many commissions on local TV channels that show the struggle for independence.

On Independence Day, the celebration begins with a flag-raising ceremony in the presidential palace. This is accompanied by high school students. On Sunday after Independence Day, the government held a marching band parade. Foreigners are welcomed by most Indonesians and can participate through sponsorship of other children’s activities or help fund various types of activities.
