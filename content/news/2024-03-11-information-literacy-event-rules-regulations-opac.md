The Adam Kurniawan Library hosted an event titled “Rules, Regulations & OPAC.” This event took place on-site at the library. Why is it important to know the rules and regulations in the library? Many students have broken the rules, such as wearing shorts, bringing food into the library, or even going on dates in the library. They should be aware of the rules they must follow.

In addition, the library has a special facility called OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog). In simple terms, it is used by students to search for books on the shelves. However, some of the students still don’t know how to do it properly. In addition, they do not know how to access the books via the call number of the OPAC. We hope this event will help them find the book better using the OPAC. (Marco/Editor)
