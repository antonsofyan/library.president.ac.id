On Thursday (09/02), Adam Kurniawan Library held an event titled “Hukum Online: How Easily Find the Results You are Looking for” for the President University students in room A429. Adam Kurniawan Library now subscribes to Hukum Online starting from January until December 2023. Miss Annisa from Hukum Online came as an expert in the event giving training to the students on how to use Hukum Online Database.

The event was meant for the students to practice and have the experience to search for information on the Hukum Online platform. Miss Annisa taught the students how to track and choose regulations, decrees, and actual information about law subjects. After attending the event, the students are expected to get information about various information in Hukum Online services and how to search for them on the platform. (Anindya/Librarian).
