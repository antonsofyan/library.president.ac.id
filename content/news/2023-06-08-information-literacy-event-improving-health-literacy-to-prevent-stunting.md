On Thursday (23/05), Adam Kurniawan Library held an event in collaboration with Dinas Perpustakaan dan Kearsipan Kabupaten Bekasi, West Java, titled “Information Literacy: Improving Health Literacy to Prevent Stunting”. The keynote speaker is Mr. Haris Herdiasnyah a Lecture at President University and an expert in Communication and Clinical Psychologist.

This Information Literacy Event offers knowledge, advice, and tactics on the mental health of moms and would-be mothers. Health literacy explains how nutrition, various health conditions of mothers and newborns, and the long-term effects on the mental, cognitive, and emotional development of infants are associated with the mental health conditions of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. Preparing for the first thousand days of life from conception is one of the efforts performed. So that they can properly prepare for pregnancy, couples getting ready to get married need to be informed on the first thousand days of life and numerous relevant topics. (Anindya/Librarian).
