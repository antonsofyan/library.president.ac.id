The Adam Kurniawan Library held an event called “Exploring Digital Library.” The digital library is an important facility that the library makes available to all students. This event held on-site at BI Corner Adam Kurniawan Library. Exploring digital libraries will help students manage their scholarly sources for assignments.

The digital library is still unfamiliar to a large number of students. Finally, students learned the process of using the E-Campus to find sources for their assignments or theses. Instead of looking for the thesis directly on the shelves, the repository’s information is required to access previous theses for reference. (Marco, the editor).
