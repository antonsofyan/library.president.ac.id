“Pancasila will Never Fade”, that was the tagline from a forum conducted on Monday, 12 June 2023 at B.I. Corner of Adam Kurniawan Library President University. The topic “Strengthening Pancasila and National Spirit in the Digital Age” was presented by Dr. Andreas Yumarma, a lecturer and student consultant of President University, Aqila Salsabila, Yasmin Audra Zahra and Salsabila Rizqina, who are students from Management Study Program, President University.

Pancasila is the philosophical foundation of the Unitary Country of Indonesia. It is a set of philosophical principles that guide the nation’s ideology and governance. The word Pancasila is derived from ‘Sanskrit’, which means five principles. These principles are belief in one God, just and civilized humanity, unity of Indonesia, democracy guided by consensus; and social justice for all.

In the era of globalization and the emergence of threat in criminal radicalism, it is important to the nation, especially the young ages, to hold to the philosophical principles like Pancasila. For example, the second principle ‘just and civilized humanity’ can be used to strengthen the foundation for young ages in fighting criminal radicalism. As for the students, the application of this principle is to be a guidance for avoiding physical, verbal or cyber bullying, those kinds of actions which can not be tolerated by President University. “Five principles of Pancasila also inspired the potential solution in dealing with the social justice implementation to societal development throughout Indonesia,” added Andreas.
