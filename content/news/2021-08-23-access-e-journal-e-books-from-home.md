Hello Presunivers and Researchers of President University, Presunivers can access E-Journals and other online resources using ANU Press, especially during online lectures and research activities from home like today.

Adam Kurniawan Library will inform you how to use ANU Press, which will later help Presunivers to access scientific references in E-Journals, E-Books, and other online resources subscribed to by President University. Currently the Australian National University Press opens access to download books published. Many books about Indonesia and Austronesia.

Come on, optimize access to E-Journals, E-Books, and other electronic references that have been subscribed to by President University. Make E-Journals and E-Books as research references and preparation of Scientific Works of the President University Academic Community.

If there are difficulties or problems, please contact us via email Reference@president.ac.id.
