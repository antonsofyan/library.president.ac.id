On Monday (19/12), Adam Kurniawan Library held an event titled “Mother’s Involvement in Young Children’s Literacy Development”. The keynote speaker is Mrs. Pelangi Efarani, a mom of Siraj Al Din Paksi, an adolescent with non-verbal autism, and Mrs. Hernawati W Retno Wiratih, S.Pd., M.Sc., MPC.

This information literacy event also explains that each child is different and has distinct abilities and challenges. It also occurs in children with disorders of any kind, including autism. Mrs. Pelangi presented experiences of the mother’s involvement in parenting for children with autism. Also, Mrs. Retno explains about psychology and how communication can impact children’s propensities and way of life patterns in the future. The main points made are how to get along with kids and raise autistic kids to be independent and respected adults. Housewives, literacy activists, primary school teachers, kindergarten teachers, and school librarians are among the attendees. It is intended that by engaging in this event, participants will be able to offer suitable approaches to parenting. (Librarian/Anindya).
