The Adam Kurniawan Library hosted an online event called “Get to Know Library Clearance” via Google Meet. This event was created specifically for students in their final year of study before graduation or students who want to drop out of their studies. Many of them are still confused about what steps they need to take for the clearance process. This entire process is stipulated in the Rector’s Regulations. The library is therefore obliged to inform students about this step.

Students who are about to leave or finish their studies are required to take this step. After they complete their thesis defense, they must upload their work to the campus publication. For scientific publication, they must also obtain the consent of their scientific supervisor. We librarians hope that this information reaches as many students as possible. (Marco/Editor).
