Meanwhile, Olga Catherina expressed her gratitude for being warmly received by Presuniv. After visiting the Adam Kurniawan Library, the UKM team continued their discussion in room A429, 4th floor of Building A, at the Presuniv Campus on Jl. Ki Hajar Dewantara, Jababeka City, Cikarang. The discussion focused on how the Adam Kurniawan Library obtained an A accreditation from the National Library, which assessed them on nine criteria. The UKM Library had previously received an A accreditation, but it was based on six criteria. This benchmarking visit was part of UKM Library’s preparation for re-accreditation under the nine criteria system. (JB Susetiyo, PR Team. Photo: JB Susetiyo).
