On October 10, 2025, Emerald Insight collaborated with the Adam Kurniawan Library to host an online Emerald Workshop via Google Meet. The event brought together faculty members and students from all bachelor's programs, the master's program in management technology, and doctoral candidates, with a total of 65 participants.

The workshop aimed to improve understanding of Emerald's academic database, a key platform for accessing peer-reviewed business, management, and economics journals. The reference librarian demonstrated how to search for scholarly articles, evaluate research impact, and utilize journal metrics effectively.

Participants were guided through step-by-step tutorials on navigating the Emerald interface, exporting citations, and integrating research materials into academic writing. Attendees also had the opportunity to engage in interactive discussions and ask questions about publication strategies and access options.

This workshop was another collaborative effort between the library and Emerald to strengthen research literacy and promote a culture of continuous academic engagement among lecturers and students alike.
