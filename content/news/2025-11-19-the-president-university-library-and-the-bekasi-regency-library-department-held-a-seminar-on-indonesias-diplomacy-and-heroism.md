The President University Library collaborated with the Bekasi Regency Library and Archives Office (DISARPUS Pemkab Bekasi) to successfully organize the seminar, titled Diplomasi dan Kepahlawanan Indonesia di Forum Dunia. The event introduced students and the academic community to Indonesia's diplomatic efforts and heroic spirit on the global stage. It took place on November 20, 2025, at the BI Corner in the Adam Kurniawan Library at President University.

Dr. Jeanne Francoise, a senior lecturer of international relations at President University, was the keynote speaker. During the session, she discussed how Indonesia's diplomatic actions and historical values of heroism contribute to shaping the nation's international image. Participants were encouraged to view diplomacy as not only statecraft but also a reflection of cultural identity and national resilience.

Attendees gained insight into how Indonesia's heroes and national narratives have influenced foreign policy approaches over time. The discussion highlighted Indonesia's participation in international forums, peacekeeping missions, and humanitarian efforts. According to the speaker, these elements represent modern expressions of heroism within global diplomacy.

Through this collaboration, President University Library and Bekasi Regency Library and Archives Office reaffirmed their commitment to promoting literacy, critical thinking, and global awareness. The seminar enhanced academic understanding and inspired attendees to appreciate Indonesia's role and responsibilities in international relations.
