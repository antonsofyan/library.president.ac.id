On Wednesday (22/02), Adam Kurniawan Library in cooperation with Dinas Perpustakaan dan Kearsipan Kabupaten Bekasi held a public event entitled **“Digital Literacy and Effective Use of Social Media”**. Ms. Anathasia Citra as the speaker gives a lot of information about how to behave on social media. “It’s not the truck you see that runs you over.” Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have impacted how we communicate with one another. In this session, we will explore this emerging challenge by discussing the behavioral health ethical codes that apply to virtual interactions and share common challenges and recommended best practices. (Anindya/Librarian).

The session was designed for the students to practice and gain experience in searching for information on the IG Library platform. Mr. Ramdhan taught the students how to track and select e-books based on subject, keywords, publisher and advanced search. After attending the session, the students are expected to get information about various subjects in the e-book collection and how to search for them on the platform. (Anindya/Librarian).
