The session provided a clear overview of both platforms, highlighting their features in managing references, organizing research materials, and integrating citations seamlessly into academic writing. The aim was to support faculty members in streamlining their research workflow, improving efficiency in handling literature, and ensuring proper citation practices in their publications.

Participants showed strong engagement throughout the event. Many lecturers expressed their interest by asking practical questions on syncing libraries, collaborating with colleagues, and choosing between Mendeley and Zotero for different research needs. The interactive discussion reflected the growing awareness of the importance of digital tools in academic research and teaching.

The session concluded with a hands-on demonstration, where lecturers were encouraged to explore the applications directly. The event successfully met its objective of empowering faculty members with practical knowledge of reference management systems, strengthening the university’s commitment to supporting high-quality research and academic integrity.
