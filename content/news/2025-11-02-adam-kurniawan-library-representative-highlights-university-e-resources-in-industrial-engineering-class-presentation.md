**Cikarang, Monday, November 3** — An Adam Kurniawan Library representative gave an informative presentation to **Industrial Engineering** students during their Indonesian Language class. The session aimed to increase students' familiarity with the university's digital learning tools and academic integrity resources.

The speaker provided an overview of the e-resources to which the university subscribes, emphasizing how these digital platforms can support research, coursework, and academic projects. Students were guided through the types of journals, databases, and online collections accessible through the library portal and received tips on how to navigate and maximize each resource.

A key segment of the session focused on **Turnitin**, the university's plagiarism detection tool. The representative explained how Turnitin maintains academic integrity, demonstrated how to submit assignments, and clarified common misconceptions about similarity reports.

The presentation also included a practical introduction to **reference management tools**, specifically **Mendeley** and **Zotero**. Students learned how these applications can streamline the citation process, organize research papers, and automatically generate bibliographies in various styles. The demonstration highlighted essential features, such as importing references, managing libraries, and integrating plug-ins with word processors.

The session concluded with a Q&A in which students asked questions about accessing digital journals, improving research strategies, and avoiding plagiarism.
