On Wednesday (28/09), Book Review “Think Big, Start Small, Move Fast” written by the Founder of President University was held in the Adam Kurniawan Library. The event began started from 16.00 until 17.00 WIB. The speaker were Mrs. Neilany Edwina Nulampau, S.Sos., M.Si., and Dr. Ir. Yunita Ismail Masjud, M.Si. The event was attended by students from various majors.

Dr. Yunita who is also a lecturer at PresUniv said that “Individuals who think holistically and behave accordingly show how much they care about their surroundings, like Mr. S.D. Darmono the author of this book, as an individual understands about what people do and how people behave will not only affect themselves but impact more widely”. Hopefully, this event can be useful for everyone, especially for the students to build the best future.
