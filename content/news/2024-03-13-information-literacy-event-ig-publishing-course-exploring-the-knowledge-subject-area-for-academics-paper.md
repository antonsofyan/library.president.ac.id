Information literacy exercises with the topic “IG Publishing Course: Exploring the Knowledge Subject Area for Academics Paper” were conducted on Wednesday, February 28, at Adam Kurniawan Library (AKL). In her capacity as IG Publishing Asia Pacific’s representative, Mrs. Sururin Maudhunah hosted the event.

The event was hosted by Fikram Maulana Aziz and Adinda Isya Handy Putri. There were two sessions to the event. The times of the two sessions are respectively 10 to 11am and 1 – 2 pm. Mrs. Sururin gave instructions on how to use the platform’s search functions and get access to IG Publishing’s e-books. It is hoped that this occasion would serve as a starting point for students to use as references when finishing homework. (Anindya/Librarian).
