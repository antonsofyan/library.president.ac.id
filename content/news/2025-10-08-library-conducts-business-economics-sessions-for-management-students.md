In each class of 35 students, participants explored research techniques, database access, and applying evidence-based information to assignments and projects. The sessions also covered the critical evaluation of online resources to promote information literacy in the field of business.

Students expressed a keen interest in learning how to leverage library tools, such as journal databases, citation managers, and online research guides. The librarian provided examples of connecting economic theories with current market data using library resources.

Integrating library instruction into the curriculum encouraged students to view the library as an active partner in their learning and analytical growth, not just a repository.
