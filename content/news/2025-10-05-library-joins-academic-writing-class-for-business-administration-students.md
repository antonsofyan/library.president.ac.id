On October 6, 2025, the Adam Kurniawan Library participated in an academic writing class for the business administration program. Laurensius Yoel Fabian, the reference librarian, represented the library and served as a guest lecturer, introducing students to effective strategies for finding, evaluating, and citing academic sources in their writing.

Twenty-six students attended the session and actively engaged in discussions about academic integrity, citation styles, and how to make the most of the library's digital resources. Practical demonstrations were provided to help students navigate scholarly databases relevant to their field of study.

The initiative also aimed to highlight the library's reference services and its role in supporting students research and writing development. By learning how to locate and cite credible sources, students gained a stronger foundation for producing high-quality academic work.

Through this collaboration between faculty and the library, students are expected to develop long-term research skills that will benefit them throughout their academic careers.
