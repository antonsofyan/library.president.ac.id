On Tuesday (20/12), Adam Kurniawan Library in cooperation with Dinas Perpustakaan dan Kearsipan Kabupaten Bekasi held a public event entitled “The role of mothers in increasing family literacy”. Ms Grace Amin as the speaker gives a lot of information about the role of mothers to increase family literacy and parenting style. Speakers and participants also discussed the variability in the effects of parenting style as a function of the child’s cultural background, the processes through which parenting style influences child development and the operationalization of parenting style. Today’s event has also provided a lot of new knowledge that we can implement to change habit and achieve literacy, especially at the family level. (Anindya/Librarian).
