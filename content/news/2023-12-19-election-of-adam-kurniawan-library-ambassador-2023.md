Adam Kurniawan Library conducted activities to select library ambassadors as one of its promotional initiatives for patrons, especially students at President University. The selection procedure for applicants chosen from each major was held from October until November 2023 by the library. On November 29, 2023, Shafa Aulia Sabrina, a student majoring in Management, and Nedichya Correia Beio, a student majoring in International Relations, were chosen to be representatives of Adam Kurniawan Library Ambassador.

The winner received the prize directly from Mrs. Neilany Edwina Nulampau, S.Sos., M.Si., Head of Adam Kurniawan Library. From the hiring of library ambassadors is expected that the library’s ambassador to act as a catalyst for the development of a reading culture among the President University’s academic community, particularly among the student’s body.
