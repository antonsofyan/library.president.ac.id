On Tuesday (25/07), Adam Kurniawan Library held an event in collaboration with Dinas Perpustakaan dan Kearsipan Kabupaten Bekasi, West Java, titled “Information Literacy: Bilingualism and Children’s Cognitive Development”. The keynote speaker is Mrs. Disa Evawani Lestari, S.S., M.Sc. a Lecture at President University and an expert in English subjects which consist of General English, English for Business, and Academic Writing.

Another option presented by this information literacy event is that bilingual youngsters will be exposed to more parental discussion about switching languages in order to attract the attention and knowledge of their parents. According to this perspective, it is not simply having access to multiple languages that fosters conversational understanding, but rather a specific sentence being highlighted in an adult language distinct from the language used in everyday conversation with other children, which facilitates the advantage displayed by bilingual children.
