“Be kind to everyone.” This is one of the keys to stop bullying as conveyed by Gia Raharja in Adam Kurniawan Library (AKL) Information Literacy Event on Tuesday, 18 July 2023. In collaboration with Saling Jaga Indonesia, the event was raised the theme “Guarding Each Other from Sexual Harassment, Bullying and Cyber Hoax in Campus”. This topic was chosen since the university students are vulnerable to these issues.

The development of digital era also has an impact on the development of sexual harassment and bullying in the form of online-based violence. In her presentation, Gia delivered 15 forms of sexual harassment and 9 types of Online Gender-Based Violence. Basically, harassment happens when there is no consent from the victim. She also mentioned that no particular gender is immune to harassment. Thus, everyone can be the victim.

The event was closed with thaiscussion session, where several students shared their experience of being the victim of harassment and bullying. Gia hopes that this event can raise awareness of the importance of guarding each other. (Chrisanny, Photo: Chrisanny, Daniel R.)
