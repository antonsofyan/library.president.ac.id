**Cikarang, November 6 - 7** — The Adam Kurniawan Library continued its academic support initiatives by delivering a series of presentations across several **Academic Writing** classes. Students from the **Informatics, Business Administration, and Accounting** programs learned about essential digital tools and resources designed to strengthen their research and writing skills.

**On Thursday, November 6**, the library representative met with students from the **Informatics** and **Business Administration** programs. The following day, **Friday, November 7**, the same session was held for the **Accounting** department. All classes received consistent materials tailored to enhance their academic writing practices.

During these sessions, the representative provided an in-depth overview of the university's E-Resources, including academic databases, digital journals, e-books, and online scholarly collections. Students learned how to navigate the library portal and use these resources for assignments, research projects, and literature reviews.

A significant part of the presentation focused on **Turnitin**, the university's plagiarism detection and similarity-checking system. The speaker emphasized the importance of academic integrity, demonstrated the submission process, and clarified how to responsibly interpret similarity reports, stressing the importance of correct citation practices rather than merely targeting low similarity scores.

The sessions also explored **reference management tools**, focusing on **Mendeley** and **Zotero**. Students learned how to collect and organize references, integrate citation tools with their writing software, and automatically generate bibliographies in different styles.

Throughout the two-day series, students actively participated in discussions and asked questions about accessing digital journals, managing citations, and enhancing the quality of their academic writing.

These presentations reflect the Adam Kurniawan Library's commitment to supporting student success by providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary for effective and ethical academic work.
