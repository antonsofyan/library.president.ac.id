Cooperative Indonesia is a business entity formed and run based on the principles of cooperatives, as a people’s economic movement with the principle of kinship. Cooperative Indonesia has the main goal, namely to create welfare for the people. Cooperatives have been established since the colonial era to overcome the poverty experienced by the people at that time.

In 1908, the association of “Budi Utomo” was founded by Raden Soetomo to utilize the cooperative sector to create the people’s welfare. Then in 1915, enacted a Cooperative Act which required the cooperative budget to use Dutch and was made before a notary public. In 1929, a party was established which aimed to disseminate the cooperative spirit, the party was the Indonesia National Party.

During the Japanese occupation, a cooperative called “Kumiyai” was established, but over time, it made the Indonesia people suffer more. After Indonesia gained independence, in 1947, Mr. Cooperative Indonesia, Bung Hatta conducted the first congress in Indonesia with the establishment of the Central Organization of Indonesia Cooperatives (SOKRI).

Era of this decade, cooperatives in Indonesia are growing so that it can help its people, cooperatives also become a tool of development development in Indonesia is increasingly rapidly.
