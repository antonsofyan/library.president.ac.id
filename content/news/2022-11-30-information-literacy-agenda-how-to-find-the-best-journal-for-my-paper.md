On Monday (07/11), Adam Kurniawan Library held an event titled “Literacy Information: How to Find Best Journal for My Paper” for the President University students in the B. I. Corner Adam Kurniawan Library. Mr. Ihsan Hadiansah came as the speaker at the event to share how to start doing research and develop ideas for a research topic based on a phenomenon.

The event was impactful for the students to practice writing papers and dig deeper into their critical thinking. Mr. Ihsan taught the students to find the best journal for writing papers, find objectives, and construct novelty. After attending the event, the students are expected to know how to find the best journal to improve their writing skills. (Anindya/Librarian, Aris Masruri/Editor).
