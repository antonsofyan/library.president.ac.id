The Adam Kurniawan Library hosted an event called “Exploring Digital Libraries.” This online event aimed to introduce students to the digital library, which many of them are not yet familiar with. How to access online resources.

The digital library is part of the online facility that allows students to access academic sources online. For example, they can receive journals, magazines, e-books or other online resources that they can use for their research. Access is possible via E-Campus, but there is a specific way to find the course on E-Campus. Therefore, it is important to let students know how they can access it. In addition, not all e-resources (e.g. Hein Online, Hukum Online, etc.) are accessible for free. Students must also be registered and granted access from campus. (Marco/Editor)
