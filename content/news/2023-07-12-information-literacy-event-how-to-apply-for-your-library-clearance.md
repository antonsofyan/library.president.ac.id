The Adam Kurniawan Library (AKL) held an online event with the topic “How to Apply for Your Library Clearance” on Wednesday, 5 July 2023. This event was part of AKL’s commitment to spreading information literacy to its users, especially President University (PresUniv) students.

Library clearance is an important point for students to finish their education at PresUniv. Alfonsus Oki, a Librarian and the person in charge of library clearance was delivering the steps and requirements of how a student should be entitled for the clearance. Some of the requirements are graduating students will need to submit the thesis soft file to the library. The librarian will check whether the students still have obligations such as book loans or fines for late book returns.

PresUniv has a high concern about plagiarism, thus before the library clearance was granted, the students also needed to provide a plagiarism check report, added Oki. The event was closed with a Q & A session to ensure that the material delivered was fully understood by the audience. (Chrisanny, Photo: Chrisanny)
